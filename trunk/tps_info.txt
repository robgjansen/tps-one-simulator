This project implemented anonymity mechanisms into the ONE DTN simulator, and measured specific performance characteristics. The base source code was taken from ONE 1.3.0, available at http://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/. I made several modifications to simulate the scheme described in the paper:

Rob Jansen and Robert Beverly, "Toward Anonymity in Delay Tolerant Networks: Threshold Pivot Scheme", MILCOM 2010.

Changelog:

sim_v5
========
-Added threshold instead of always using number of groups as threshold

sim_v4.1
========
-Added capability to run any scheme
-Updated settings to separate file instead of using default settings
-Updated some settings to more appropirate values
-Re-ran all experiements with this version, with 10 seeds
-Added script to parse and compute combined results for all experiments

sim_v4.0
========
-Implemented random pivot scheme
-Changed algorithm to random pivot scheme

sim_v3.0
========
-Added euclidean distance for exit node to source at point when message is decrypted
-Added log of euclidean distance
-Added script to parse and plot a cdf of distance

sim_v2.0
========
-Added anonymous message capabilities.
-Times are now measured as message transfer times, not node travel times.
-Messages are "encrypted" to start with, until they travel through every group.
 At this point, they become "decrypted" and are routed to destination as normal.
-FirstContact is used without attempts to optimize to who to send the encrypted message
 (some nodes might not be able to help since its "color" was already removed)
-Updated cdf generator to handle new logged timestamps

sim_v1.1
========
-Updated log parser and cdf generator.

sim_v1.0
========
-Anonymous groups only. 
-No message routing. 
-Generated logs represent times it takes for a node to meet all groups.
